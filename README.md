We've all faced the anxiety and nervousness before an important interview or presentation, the load of long meetings and the overwhelming nature of work. The app provides the feature to quickly clear your head and relax yourself using the three different time durations and rain and beach modes with calming sounds to help you meditate and ace at work!

## Posture Checker

Long and exhausting meetings can often take a toll on your back. You can now check your posture and orientation before heading to your next meeting using the posture checker included in the app.Currently both functions will run simultaneously if the posture "check button" is pushed after the "orientation check" button. A refresh in between button clicks is needed to run each function separately.
It has been built using TensorFlow set up Javascript to capture an image from webcam feed at 0.5 second intervals and analyze the image to collect certain data points about the users face and shoulders. This data is then used to determine whether the user is in the proper orientation.

## Agile Methodology

In accordance with the principles of Agile Methodology, this project has been built in four sprints spread evenly over a month. As per the advice of my mentors, I had a roadmap ready for each week before hand and made use of two tools, namely a Trello Sprint Board and an Excel Agile Gantt sheet to track my progress.

To stay on track with deadlines, assignment and mentor meetings, I have used the Agile Sprint Board by Trello. 
Here I kept adding the tasks to lists divided according to the sprints. I also maintained an active backlog and to do list in order to get things done efficiently. 

### Excel Agile GANTT Chart To Monitor Progress

I have used the Agile Gantt Chart provided by Microsoft Excel to monitor the progress of the project over the four weeks. I have listed the features included in the app week wise along with their progress, category, status, start and end dates. The same was shared with my mentors, Pranav and Ritvik to keep them updated as well.
